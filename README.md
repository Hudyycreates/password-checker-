🛡️ Password Entropy Advisor
This is a project I built while taking CS50 Intro to Cybersecurity.

🧠 What I Learned

I wanted to apply the concept of Password Entropy to a real-world tool. I used AI to help me build the web interface using Streamlit, while I focused on implementing the security math:

Pool Size: Calculating the character set based on user input.

Entropy: Calculating strength in bits (E=L⋅log(subcript)2 R).

Crack Time: Estimating how long a 100-billion-guesses-per-second rig would take to break the password.
